# Portfolio Heatmap

Portfolio Heatmap is an interactive web-based dashboard that visualizes your investment portfolio using a dynamic treemap layout. Each investment is represented by a tile whose area is proportional to its value, and the tiles display the daily percentage change along with detailed information on hover.

## Features

- **Dynamic Treemap Layout:**  
  Tiles are arranged using a slice-and-dice treemap algorithm, where each tileâ€™s area is proportional to the investment value.

- **Interactive Investment Tiles:**  
  - **Default View:** Shows the stock ticker and daily percentage change.
  - **Hover View:** Reveals detailed information such as the number of shares, average price, and total investment value, along with edit/delete options.

- **Investment Management:**  
  Easily add, edit, or delete investments using a user-friendly interface.

- **Persistent Data:**  
  A lightweight Python backend with SQLite stores your investment data persistently. Data will remain even after restarting the app.

- **Responsive & Modern Design:**  
  Features a sleek dark theme that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Project Structure
- **/static:** Contains all your CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
- **/templates:** Contains your HTML files.
- **app.py:** Runs the Flask server, serves the frontend, and provides REST API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- **/venv:** Holds your Python virtual environment (ensure this is added to your `.gitignore`).
