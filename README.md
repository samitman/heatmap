# Portfolio Heatmap

Portfolio Heatmap is an interactive web-based dashboard that visualizes your investment portfolio using a dynamic treemap layout. Each investment is represented by a tile whose area is proportional to its value, and the tiles display the daily percentage change along with detailed information on hover.
